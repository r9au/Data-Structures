//5- A ball released from height h each time it bounces on floor its velocity becomes halved write a c program which reads the value of y and prints total distance travelled by the ball when it touches the floor for 3rd time and g is 9.8
//Ans-
/* Algorithm
step1- Start:
Initialize variables i, space, rows=6, and k=0.
step2- Main Loop:
Start a loop from i=1 to i<=rows:
Set k to 0 at the beginning of each iteration.
step3- Print Spaces Loop:
Inside the main loop, start a nested loop from space=1 to space<=rows-i:
Print a space.
Print Asterisks Loop:
step4- Inside the main loop, start another loop-
Loop while k is not equal to 2*i-1:
Print an asterisk.
Increment k.
step5- Print Newline:
Print a newline to move to the next row after completing each row.
step6- End of Main Loop:
End the main loop.
step7- Stop:
End the program. */
