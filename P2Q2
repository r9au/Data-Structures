/*Q2- Currency notes are available in the following seven denominations: Rs. 1, Rs. 
2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 20, Rs.50, and Rs. 100.
You will first read an integer array (named purse [7]) of seven elements, where 
the array elements represents the number of notes of each denomination (in 
increasing order of denomination) available with you. You are also given an 
amount of money to be paid using these notes. The amount will be less than Rs. 
1000. You have to pay the amount using minimum number of notes. Print the 
number of notes of each denomination which you will use to pay the amount. If 
the amount cannot be paid using the available notes, print "Failed to Pay".
Ans
Algorithm
Step 1 - Start
Step 2 - Initialize array arr1, arr2, pay, totalNotes, i, and j
Step 3 - Input elements into array arr1 using a loop from i=0 to 6
 a - Loop start
 b - Display prompt for input
 c - Read and store the input value in arr1[i]
 d - Loop end
Step 4 - Input elements into array arr2 using a loop from i=0 to 6
 a - Loop start
 b - Display prompt for input
 c - Read and store the input value in arr2[i]
 d - Loop end
Step 5 - Input the amount to pay (pay)
 a - Display prompt for input
 b - Read and store the input value in pay
Step 6 - Initialize p1, p2, and p3
 a - Calculate p1 as (pay / 100) * 100
 b - Calculate p2 as (pay / 10) * 10
 c - Calculate p3 as pay % 10
Step 7 - Loop from i=6 to 0
 a - Loop start
 b- Loop from j=6 to 0
 c- Loop start
 d- While arr1[i] * arr2[j] > p1
 e- Decrease arr2[j] by 1
 f- If arr1[i] * arr2[j] is equal to p1
 g - Increment totalNotes by arr2[j]
 h- Display "Rs. arr1[i]: arr2[j] notes"
 i- Break from the loop
 j – exit both loops
Step 8 - Similar loop structures for p2 and p3
Step 9 - Display The total number of notes used is: totalNotes
Step 10 – stop*/
